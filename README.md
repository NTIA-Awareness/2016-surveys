## Working Group Background

On March 19, 2015, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, working with the Department of Commerce's Internet Policy Task Force (IPTF), issued a Request for Comment to "identify substantive cybersecurity issues that affect the digital ecosystem and digital economic growth where broad consensus, coordinated action, and the development of best practices could substantially improve security for organizations and consumers." Individuals and entities from across the commercial, academic, and civil society sectors filed comments. After reviewing these comments, NTIA announced that the first topic to be addressed would be collaboration on vulnerability research disclosure.

The goal of this process will be to develop a broad, shared understanding of the overlapping interests between security researchers and the vendors and owners of products discovered to be vulnerable, and to establish a consensus about voluntary principles to promote better collaboration.  The question of how vulnerabilities can and should be disclosed will be a critical part of the discussion, as will how vendors receive and respond to this information. However, disclosure is only one aspect of successful collaboration.

## Researcher and Vulnerability Managment Survey Background

A coalition of cybersecurity experts participating in a program to promote greater understanding and adoption of best practices for security vulnerability disclosure and handling today launched two surveys to investigate awareness of and perspectives on the issue. The coalition is made up of members of the “Awareness and Adoption Group” participating in a multistakeholder process on vulnerability disclosure and handling, which is being convened by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

As software and technology systems become more advanced and complex, their potential to contain issues that negatively impact users increases. Such issues, known as vulnerabilities, may also create opportunities for malicious attackers. Vulnerabilities are often found and addressed during the development, and prior to the market release, of software and technology systems, but testing for everything is impossible. As a result, vulnerabilities may still be found in products and online services, either through intentional investigation or accidental discovery. In both situations, a clear path for security researchers or discoverers to disclose their findings to technology developers, manufacturers, and service providers helps to resolve issues without exposing users to undue risk. A clear path is often part of a “vulnerability handling” policy, process, or program.

While much work has previously been undertaken to develop best practices for vulnerability disclosure and handling – resulting in two International Standards Organization (ISO) standards, ISO/IEC 29147 and ISO/IEC 30111 – adoption of these practices is not yet widespread. The Awareness and Adoption Group wants to understand how broad adoption of vulnerability disclosure and handling policies and practices is, including in various industry sectors and among researchers and organizations in different working contexts. Where there are barriers to adoption, the Group seeks to identify what they may be and to develop responsive guidance.

The Group is investigating these issues by surveying the main stakeholder groups involved: technology providers and operators, who may receive reports about potential vulnerabilities; and security researchers, who may report potential vulnerabilities to technology providers and operators. Anonymized information will be gathered through two short (less than 10 questions each) surveys online. The resulting data will be aggregated and analyzed for a report that will be issued to the public later in 2016. Based on the findings, the report will recommend actions to increase adoption of vulnerability disclosure and handling best practices.

“Ultimately our goal is to help make everyone safer; given the trust we place in technology in every area of our lives, it’s important to understand that vulnerabilities can have a negative impact on people’s safety and identity, as well as reaching a scale of national security or economic stability,” said Jen Ellis, Vice President of Community and Public Affairs at Rapid7, and co-chair of the Awareness and Adoption Group. “Addressing this requires open collaboration between researchers and technology providers and operators, and we believe that a strategic and thoughtful approach to vulnerability disclosure and handling is a very important element of this.”

“We hope that people will approach these surveys in a spirit of openness so we can understand real world perspectives and make appropriate recommendations,” said Amanda Craig, Senior Cybersecurity Strategist at Microsoft, and co-chair of the Awareness and Adoption Group. “There has traditionally been a perception of a somewhat adversarial relationship between researchers and technology providers and operators. We want to move past this, and the common assumptions it engenders, to understand current experience with, and perspectives on, vulnerability disclosure and handling. It’s only by understanding what’s really happening that we can make meaningful recommendations for increasing adoption of best practices.”
